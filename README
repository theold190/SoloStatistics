Brief
    This is a home made Google Chrome extension for tracking progress in 
    ErgoSolo course (http://nabiraem.ru). The idea of the course is to 
    teach people to type with 8 fingers and 2 thumbs without peeking to 
    the keyboard. This extension is keeping you only one click away 
    from yours or your friends achievements.

    Extension is using scripts and resources from http://nabiraem.ru. 
    Check demo sub folder for the extension's screenshots.

Installation
    Drag and drop a .CRX file to your Google Chrome to install it. First 
    time you will be asked to fill in some data.

    Starting from version 0.5 extension should update automatically.
